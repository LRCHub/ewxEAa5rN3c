I need TLC ASAP
Well, my muscles ache
And my feet are sore.
Thank God it's Friday,
And it's almost four!
Time to hit the door!
Gonna spend the weekend
On the lake.
We've been workin' overtime
And we need a break
And, Honey, I can't wait!
We know how to spell relief,
Got a good old fashion recipe
A little TLC ASAP
A little R & R for you and me
A guaranteed rat race remedie,
A little TLC ASAP.
Bring a book to read,
And a change of clothes.
Well, I packed the cooler
And the Coleman stove,
And the radio.
We can float on a raft
In the sun all day
We can love in the moonlight,
Hours away,
While the crickets play.
Well, we work real hard six days a week,
Honey, this is somethin' we both need
A little TLC ASAP
A little R & R for you and me
A guaranteed rat race remedie,
A little TLC ASAP.
A little TLC ASAP
A little R & R for you and me
A guaranteed rat race remedie,
I need TLC ASAP.
TLC ASAP
R & R for you and me
TLC ASAP
R & R for you and me
